* TODO MAYBE Python package names do not use underscores, so all underscores
  are automatically changed to hyphens. Do we change the package name?
* DONE Need to package Slurm script templates since PyPA does not support arbitrary data files.
** Instead of packaging the templates, put them in the README
* DONE Have not properly dealt with all_experiments=True + repetitions_per_run:
** DONE Need to create separate job script for each experiment.
** DONE How to handle case where number of repetitions == 1: it's OK for #SBATCH --array=1-1
